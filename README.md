# Onboarding Plugin for Moodle

## Key Functionalities

### Wiki
The plugin enables businesses or organizations to quickly set up an internal wiki for their digital tools and sources of information.

### Steps
The plugin enables businesses or organizations to easily set up a 'first steps' - program that guides the user through certain topics and tasks.

### Experiences
The plugin enables businesses or organizations to easily provide a platform for their employees, members, students etc. to exchange experiences related to the institution. These experiences can be grouped into different categories like for example work, sport, social events etc. Connecting memebers of an institution in such a way has several positive effects:
- bringing people closer together, thus lowering the risk of members feeling left alone
- improving the horizontal flow of information inside organizations
- members can learn from the mistakes made by others
- members might get a clearer vision of where they can go, thus increaing motivation
