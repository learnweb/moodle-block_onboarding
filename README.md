# Experiences Plugin for Moodle
This project is devoted to creating a block plugin for Moodle that enables businesses or organizations to easily provide a platform for their employees, members, students etc. to exchange experiences related to the institution. These experiences can be grouped into different categories like for example work, sport, social events etc. Connecting memebers of an institution in such a way has several positive effects:
- bringing people closer together, thus lowering the risk of members feeling left alone
- improving the horizontal flow of information inside organizations
- members can learn from the mistakes made by others
- members might get a clearer vision of where they can go, thus increaing motivation

As all of these effects aim at bringing people together and introducing them to an organization they even increase in their strength when used as part of an onboarding strategy.
