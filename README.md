# Steps Plugin for Moodle
This project is devoted to creating a block plugin for Moodle that enables businesses or organizations to easily set up a 'first steps' - program that guides the user through certain topics and tasks. This can especially be helpful in the broader context of setting up an effective onboarding strategy.
